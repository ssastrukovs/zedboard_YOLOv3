# zedboard_YOLOv3 improved code
Contains code for implementing the YOLOv3 CNN on ZedBoard.

After following this tutorial: https://digikogu.taltech.ee/et/Download/6c8fe4a6-97dc-4235-aac5-7470bd0b9487, I encountered some problems with displaying names of detected classes on a result image.
So, I slightly modified the code to display those classes and their probabilities directly on an image, and also in a console.

Just replace the "src" folder, when you're done following the aforementioned tutorial :)
